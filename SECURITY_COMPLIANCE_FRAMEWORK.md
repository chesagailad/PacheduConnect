## Fraud Prevention System

### Real-Time Risk Assessment

#### Risk Factors
1. **Transaction Risk**
   - Amount thresholds
   - Frequency patterns
   - Geographic anomalies
   - Time-based patterns

2. **User Risk**
   - Account age
   - Verification status
   - Historical behavior
   - Device fingerprinting

3. **Device Risk**
   - IP geolocation
   - Device characteristics
   - Browser fingerprinting
   - Behavioral patterns

#### Risk Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
Risk Score = (Transaction Risk × 0.4) + (User Risk × 0.3) + (Device Risk × 0.3)
```

#### Risk Levels
- **LOW (0-30)**: Automatic approval
- **MEDIUM (31-70)**: Manual review required
- **HIGH (71-100)**: Blocked transaction

### Fraud Detection Features
