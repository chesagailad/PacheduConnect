# Security & Compliance Implementation

## PCI-DSS Compliance

### Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented to achieve PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance for the PacheduConnect payment system.

### Implemented Security Measures

#### 1. Data Encryption (PCI-DSS Requirement 3.4)

**AES-256-GCM Encryption**
- All sensitive payment data is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Master encryption key stored securely in environment variables
- Key derivation using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Separate encryption contexts for different data types:
  - `payment_card`: Credit/debit card information
  - `bank_account`: Bank account details
  - `general`: Other sensitive data

**Encrypted Data Fields:**
- Card numbers, CVV, expiry dates
- Bank account numbers, routing numbers
- Authentication tokens
- Session data

#### 2. Secure Data Transmission (PCI-DSS Requirement 4.1)

**HTTPS Enforcement**
- All payment endpoints require HTTPS in production
- TLS 1.2+ enforced for all communications
- Secure headers implemented:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`
  - `X-Frame-Options`
  - `Content-Security-Policy`

#### 3. Access Control (PCI-DSS Requirement 7)

**Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session validation middleware
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Password complexity requirements

#### 4. Audit Logging (PCI-DSS Requirement 10)

**Comprehensive Audit Trail**
- All payment operations logged
- Sensitive data access tracked
- Authentication events recorded
- Security alerts generated
- Audit logs retained for compliance

**Logged Events:**
- Payment initiation, completion, failure
- Card data access, encryption, decryption
- User authentication, authorization
- System configuration changes
- Security alerts and incidents

#### 5. Vulnerability Management (PCI-DSS Requirement 6)

**Security Headers**
- XSS protection enabled
- CSRF protection implemented
- Content type sniffing prevented
- Frame injection blocked

**Input Validation**
- Payment data validation (Luhn algorithm for card numbers)
- CVV format validation
- Expiry date validation
- Bank routing number validation

#### 6. Network Security (PCI-DSS Requirement 1)

**Network Controls**
- CORS configuration with allowed origins
- Rate limiting on payment endpoints
- Request origin validation
- IP-based access controls

### AES Compliance

#### Encryption Standards
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Length**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **IV Length**: 128 bits (16 bytes)
- **Auth Tag**: 128 bits (16 bytes)
- **Salt Length**: 512 bits (64 bytes)

#### Key Management
- Master key stored in environment variables
- Key derivation using PBKDF2
- Purpose-specific key derivation
- Secure key rotation capabilities

#### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Encryption in transit for all communications
- Secure key storage and handling
- Data sanitization for logging

### Implementation Details

#### Security Middleware Stack
```javascript
// Applied to all payment routes
router.use(secureHeaders);
router.use(enforceHTTPS);
router.use(validateOrigin);
router.use(validateSessionSecurity);
router.use(preventDataLeakage);
router.use(logPaymentOperations);
```

#### Encryption Service Usage
```javascript
// Encrypt sensitive data
const encryptedCardData = encryptionService.encryptCardData({
  cardNumber: '4111111111111111',
  cvv: '123',
  expiryMonth: 12,
  expiryYear: 2025
});

// Decrypt sensitive data
const decryptedCardData = encryptionService.decryptCardData(encryptedCardData);
```

#### Audit Logging
```javascript
// Log payment operations
auditLogger.logPaymentOperation(
  auditLogger.eventTypes.PAYMENT_INITIATED,
  paymentData,
  user,
  ipAddress
);

// Log security alerts
auditLogger.logSecurityAlert(
  'invalid_card_number',
  details,
  'warning',
  user,
  ipAddress
);
```

### Environment Variables

#### Required Security Variables
```bash
# Encryption
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=your_64_character_encryption_master_key

# Security Configuration
MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH=12
SESSION_TIMEOUT=86400
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=5

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
1. **Never log sensitive data** - Use audit logging with data sanitization
2. **Validate all inputs** - Implement comprehensive input validation
3. **Use encryption for sensitive data** - Always encrypt before storage
4. **Follow principle of least privilege** - Grant minimal required access
5. **Implement proper error handling** - Don't expose sensitive information in errors

#### For Operations
1. **Secure environment variables** - Use secure secret management
2. **Regular security updates** - Keep dependencies updated
3. **Monitor audit logs** - Review security events regularly
4. **Implement backup encryption** - Encrypt all backups
5. **Conduct regular security assessments** - Penetration testing and audits

### Incident Response

2. **Investigation**: Review audit logs and system state
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems if necessary
4. **Recovery**: Restore from secure backups
5. **Post-incident**: Document lessons learned and update procedures
