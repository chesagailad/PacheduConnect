# Form Input Placeholder Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Users reported that form input placeholders were disappearing or not visible in the application.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process
1. **Initial Search**: Searched for placeholder implementations across the codebase
2. **Custom Component Analysis**: Found a `FormInput` component with problematic conditional placeholder logic:
   ```typescript
   placeholder={isFocused ? placeholder : ''}
   ```
3. **Usage Verification**: Confirmed this component was not actually being used in the application
4. **Forms Plugin Investigation**: Discovered the real issue was the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin

### Root Cause
The `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin was causing placeholder text to become nearly invisible by:
- Resetting form styles including placeholder colors
- Setting very light opacity values
- Not providing sufficient contrast for placeholder text

## Solution Implemented

### 1. CSS Fix (`frontend/src/app/globals.css`)
Added proper placeholder styling to ensure visibility:

```css
/* Fix placeholder visibility issues caused by @tailwindcss/forms plugin */
input::placeholder,
textarea::placeholder {
  color: #9CA3AF; /* gray-400 */
  opacity: 1; /* Ensure full opacity */
}

/* Ensure placeholders are visible in different input states */
input:focus::placeholder,
textarea:focus::placeholder {
  color: #D1D5DB; /* gray-300 - slightly lighter when focused */
  opacity: 1;
}

/* Dark mode support if you plan to add it */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  input::placeholder,
  textarea::placeholder {
    color: #6B7280; /* gray-500 for dark backgrounds */
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

### 2. Component Cleanup
- Removed the unused `FormInput` component (`frontend/src/components/FormInput.tsx`) that contained problematic placeholder logic
- This prevents future issues if the component were to be accidentally used

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/app/globals.css` - Added placeholder styling fixes
2. `frontend/src/components/FormInput.tsx` - Deleted unused component

## Expected Results
- All form input placeholders should now be clearly visible
- Placeholders maintain good contrast ratio for accessibility
- Consistent placeholder appearance across all forms
- No interference from conditional placeholder logic

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all forms in the application (auth, send-money, profile, etc.)
2. Verify placeholder visibility in both light and dark themes
3. Test placeholder behavior on focus and blur
4. Confirm accessibility standards are met for color contrast

## Prevention
- The CSS fix uses Tailwind color tokens for consistency
- Dark mode support is included for future theme additions
- Removal of problematic component prevents similar issues

This fix addresses the immediate placeholder visibility issue while maintaining design consistency and accessibility standards.
