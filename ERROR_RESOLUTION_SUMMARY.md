# Error Resolution Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. üö´ Frontend Import Errors (Primary Issue)
**Problem**: Multiple files were missing the `API_CONFIG` import, causing `undefined` errors when trying to access `API_CONFIG.BASE_URL`.

**Files Fixed**:
- `frontend/src/app/send-money/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/PaymentProcessor.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/transactions/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/NotificationBell.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/CurrencyConverter.tsx`

**Solution**: Added the missing import statement:
```javascript
import { API_CONFIG } from '@/config/api';
```

### 2. üí• Backend Database Connection Error
**Problem**: The backend server cannot start because PostgreSQL database is not running.

**Error**: `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432`

**Current Status**: Backend fails to start due to missing database connection.

### 3. üîß Corrupted Database Configuration File
**Problem**: The `backend/src/utils/database.js` file was severely corrupted with duplicated and mixed code structures.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the file with proper:
- Import statements
- Database connection logic
- Model associations
- Error handling

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Frontend**: Import errors fixed, but still returns 500 because backend is not running
‚úÖ **Backend Code**: Syntax errors fixed
‚ùå **Backend Service**: Not running due to database connection issues

## Next Steps to Complete the Fix

### Option 1: Start PostgreSQL Service
```bash
# If PostgreSQL is installed locally
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
```

### Option 2: Use Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# Start all services with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Modify for Development Without Database
Set environment variable to skip database connection:
```bash
export SKIP_DB=true
cd backend && npm run dev
```

## About the "popup.js" Error

The original `popup.js` error was likely a red herring from a browser extension or developer tools. The actual issues were the missing imports in your React components, which caused the 500 Internal Server Error.

## Verification

Once the database is running, test the application:
```bash
# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Test frontend (should no longer return 500)
curl http://localhost:3000
```
